Imperative Approach
The cookSteakImperative function demonstrates an imperative programming approach. It provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for cooking a steak, including preheating the grill, seasoning the steak, cooking it to the desired doneness, and serving it.

Usage
To use the cookSteakImperative function, provide the steak weight in ounces and the desired doneness temperature in Celsius as arguments.

Declarative Approach
The cookSteakDeclarative function demonstrates a declarative programming approach. It describes the cooking process at a higher level, focusing on what needs to be done rather than how to do it. The process is defined as a series of actions without specifying the exact steps or implementation details.

Usage
To use the cookSteakDeclarative function, provide the steak weight in ounces and the desired doneness temperature in Celsius as arguments.
